# About SweatLog

The name of our web application is SweatLog. It was developed with the fitness enthusiast in mind. The features of SweatLog include logging your workouts, a "Benchmarks" section to record personal records or goals, a map to find a gym near you, a timer, and a technique guide for movements.

The technologies used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, Angular Material, Nodejs, and Express. GitHub was used for source control and for our project board to keep up with weekly sprints. We used MongoDB and mLab for our database. The app was deployed on Heroku. SweatLog was built for use on a desktop or mobile device.
